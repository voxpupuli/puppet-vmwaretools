##Overview

This Puppet module manages the installation and configuration of the [Operating System Specific Packages](http://packages.vmware.com/) for VMware Tools.  This allows you to use your operating system's native tools to install and update the VMware Tools.

##Module Description

This Puppet module manages the installation and configuration of the [Operating System Specific Packages](http://packages.vmware.com/) for VMware Tools.  OSPs are an alternative to the existing mechanism used to install VMware Tools through the VMware vSphereâ„¢ Client. With OSPs you can use the native update mechanisms of your operating system to download, install, and manage VMware Tools. With OSPs you can manage VMware Tools from the virtual machine as you would other standard software. VMware Tools OSPs occupy a smaller amount of disk space than the tar installer used with vSphere Client, which makes package installation or uninstallation fast.

##Setup

###What this module affects

* Removes old VMwareTools package or runs vmware-uninstall-tools.pl if found.
* Installs a VMware package repository (defaults to the 'latest' package repository).
* Installs the OSP VMware Tools.
* Starts the vmware-tools service.

###Requirements

You need to be running a virtual machine on the VMware platform and on an operating system supported by VMware's OSPs for this module to do anything.

###Beginning with this module

It is safe for all nodes to use this declaration.  Any non-VMware or unsupported system will skip installtion of the tools.
```puppet
include ::vmwaretools
```

###Upgrading

####Deprecation Warning

The parameters `yum_server`, `yum_path`, and `just_prepend_yum_path` will be renamed to be `reposerver`, `repopath`, and `just_prepend_repopath` respectively in version 5.0.0 of this module.  Please be aware that your manifests may need to change to account for the new syntax.

This:

```puppet
class { '::vmwaretools':
  yum_server            => 'http://server.example.lan',
  yum_path              => '/dir/v2.3.0',
  just_prepend_yum_path => true,
}
```

would become this:

```puppet
class { '::vmwaretools':
  reposerver            => 'http://server.example.lan',
  repopath              => '/dir/v2.3.0',
  just_prepend_repopath => true,
}
```

##Usage

All interaction with the vmwaretools module can be done through the main vmwaretools class. This means you can simply toggle the options in ::vmwaretools to have full functionality of the module.

To set the version to install, set the following parameter:

```puppet
class { '::vmwaretools':
  tools_version => '4.0u3',
}
```

Mirror packages.vmware.com to a local host and point the vmwaretools class at it.

```puppet
class { '::vmwaretools':
  reposerver            => 'http://server.example.lan',
  repopath              => '/dir/v2.3.0',
  just_prepend_repopath => true,
}
```

Turn off configuration of the software repository so that some other tool (ie RHN Satellite) or class can take care of it.

```puppet
class { '::vmwaretools':
  manage_repository => false,
}
```

##Reference

##Limitations

###OS Support:

VMware Tools Operating System Specific Packages official [supported guest operating systems](http://packages.vmware.com/) are available for these operating systems:

* Community ENTerprise Operating System (CentOS)
  * 4.0 through 6.x
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  * 3.0 through 6.x
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
  * 9 through 11
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop
  * 10 through 11
* Ubuntu Linux
  * 8.04 through 12.04

###Notes:

* Only tested on CentOS 5.5+ and CentOS 6.2+ x86_64 with 4.0latest.
* Not supported on Fedora or Debian as these distros are not supported by the OSP.
* Not supported on RHEL/CentOS/OEL 7+ or SLES 12 as VMware is [recommending
  open-vm-tools](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2073803) instead.  Use
  [razorsedge/openvmtools](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/razorsedge/openvmtools)
  instead.
* Supports repo proxy, proxy_username, proxy_password, priorities, yum repo
  protection, and using a local mirror for the reposerver and repopath.
* Supports not managing the repo configuration via `manage_repository => false`.
* No other VM tools (ie [Open Virtual Machine
  Tools](http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/)) will be supported.

###Issues:

* Does not install Desktop (X Window) components.
* Does not handle RHEL5 i386 PAE kernel on OSP 5.0+.
