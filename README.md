master branch: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/razorsedge/puppet-vmwaretools.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/razorsedge/puppet-vmwaretools)
develop branch: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/razorsedge/puppet-vmwaretools.png?branch=develop)](http://travis-ci.org/razorsedge/puppet-vmwaretools)

Introduction
------------

This module manages the installation of the [VMware Operating System Specific Packages](http://packages.vmware.com/) for VMware tools.

Actions:

* Removes old VMwareTools package or runs vmware-uninstall-tools.pl if found.
* Installs a VMware YUM repository (defaults to the 'latest' package repository which is presently 5.0).
* Installs the OSP vmware tools.
* Starts the vmware-tools service.

OS Support:

* RedHat family - tested on CentOS 5.5+ and CentOS 6.2+
* Fedora        - not supported
* SuSE family   - untested (initial support for yumrepo) (patches welcome)
* Ubuntu        - initial support using opem-vm-tools, currently untested (patches welcome)
* Debian        - initial support using opem-vm-tools, currently "works for me" status (patches welcome)

Class documentation is available via puppetdoc.

Examples
--------

Top Scope variable (i.e. via Dashboard):
```puppet
$vmwaretools_tools_version = '4.1'
$vmwaretools_autoupgrade = true
include 'vmwaretools'
```

Parameterized Class:
```puppet
class { 'vmwaretools':
  tools_version => '4.0u3',
  autoupgrade   => true,
}
```

Mirror packages.vmware.com to a local host and point the vmwaretools class at it.
```puppet
class { 'vmwaretools':
  yum_server            => 'http://yumserver.example.lan',
  yum_path              => '/yumdir/v2.3.0',
  just_prepend_yum_path => true,
}
```

Notes
-----

* Only tested on CentOS 5.5+ and CentOS 6.2+ x86_64 with 4.0latest.
* Not supported on Fedora.  Attempts to work with open-vm-tools from the Fedora
  repository were met with difficulty as the packages do not exist in newer
  Fedora versions.
* Supports yumrepo proxy, proxy_username, proxy_password, yum priorities, yum repo
  protection, and using a local mirror for the yum_server and yum_path.

Issues
------

* Does not install Desktop (X Window) components.

TODO
----

* Support installation of Desktop (X Window) packages.
* Add logic to handle RHEL5 i386 PAE kernel on OSP 5.0+.
* Add support for Ubuntu OSP packages
